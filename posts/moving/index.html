  "articleBody": "Where to Live in Tokyo: Practical Advice for First-Time Movers This article is a bit of a shift from my usual blog entries—rather than personal reflection, I wanted to offer some more practical advice for those navigating their first move in Tokyo.\nFour moves into my Japan experience, and I can confirm: it doesn’t get less stressful. Finding the right place in Tokyo, with its overwhelming options, is a challenge. For those new to the city, it’s especially daunting. After learning from my own mistakes, here’s what I wish I’d known before moving from Kyushu.\nHow to Decide Where to Live Budget This is probably the most important factor, but once you start looking at different options, it’ll be tempting to loosen your budget when you see what’s out there. It’s important to stick to your budget and remember that there are other costs to consider besides the base rent.\nThe 管理費 (maintenance fee), usually around ¥10,000/month, is typically added to the base rent. Also, be prepared for substantial initial fees, often totaling three to four times the monthly rent, including the first one or two months’ rent paid upfront.\nProximity In a city with seemingly endless choices, proximity is a crucial factor. When I first arrived in Tokyo for graduate school, I prioritized proximity to campus. While this ensured an easy commute to class, it limited my access to other parts of the city.\nWork or school proximity is important, but don’t overlook train station access. In Tokyo, the convenience of the train network can often outweigh the benefits of living right next to your daily destination.\nAlso, while the convenience of major hubs like Shinjuku or Ikebukuro is tempting, consider the sheer volume of daily commuters. If you prefer to avoid large crowds, it may be more practical to live slightly further away from these high-traffic areas.\nHow to Find Places Trains Tokyo’s extensive train network significantly impacts daily life. If you’re new to the city, understanding the nuances of each line can be difficult at first.\nI learned that accessibility is key. Popular lines like the Yamanote Line offer exceptional convenience, but come with higher rent. Similarly, properties closer to major stations tend to be more expensive.\nA helpful guideline is to live relatively close to two different stations, ideally one JR line and one Metro line. While one line might seem sufficient, having access to multiple lines significantly improves your flexibility and commute options.## How to Find Places\nSUUMO SUUMO has been my go-to resource for apartment hunting. Its comprehensive listings allow for detailed searches by:\nBudget Station access Layout (1K, 1LDK, 2LDK, etc.) Amenities (e.g., separate toilet and bath, south-facing windows) Other platforms like Open House and Daiwa also exist, but I’ve found SUUMO to be the most thorough—with the added bonus of fewer follow-up sales calls.\nReal Estate Offices After identifying properties on SUUMO, you can request viewings or information, which connects you with a real estate office. Alternatively, you can walk through neighborhoods of interest and view physical listings posted outside local real estate agencies.\nIf you find something promising, inquire directly or schedule an appointment. Viewing multiple properties can feel urgent, but it’s important to remember that this is a big decision. Don’t settle—if something feels off, walk away. There are plenty of other options.\n",
