      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking about what it means to ‘find yourself.’ I naively thought this was something you only had to do once, and once you figured it out, it’d be smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the typical story arc and I thought I was close to &amp;lsquo;finding myself.&amp;rsquo; It had been almost 10 years since I moved to Japan and I had finally moved to the big city, got my first big girl job, and got married. I thought I had it all figured out, and from the outside it must have looked that way. Sure, my job was not easy and I didn’t like it very much, but I thought eventually I’d find my groove. You know, the way they do in the movies right before everything in their lives comes together and they live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
