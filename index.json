[{"content":"People always seem to be quite wary about long distance relationships, and for valid reasons. It usually comes down to a cost-benefit analysis; wondering whether the short amount of time you do have together is worth the time spent apart and loneliness and challenges that come with distance. And there is no right answer; there’s just too many unknown variables.\nThe Start of Our Long Distance Relationship But as a stupid 18 year old I didn’t even think twice and I had just accepted it as a chapter of our relationship that we’d just have to get through. I knew that choosing to live abroad in Japan meant that a long distance relationship would be inevitable, but like any naive high schooler I thought that love conquered all. Even though my mom nudged me to break things off before I moved to Japan, I was as stubborn as ever, and even slightly insulted that she would even bring it up. In retrospect I know she was just trying to protect me from the inevitable heartbreak, but I couldn’t see it at the time.\nNaive Expectations and Real-Life Struggles We went into it pretty blindly with the end goal being four long years away. We made up our own rules as we went along, each more unrealistic and stupid than the last. We were just kids who didn’t know what it meant to be in a healthy relationship, let alone a long distance one. We already had problems before I left for Japan and the ocean between us only made things worse. My entire existence began to revolve around him and it was starting to become unhealthy. But this was the only relationship I knew, so it was easy to dismiss the signs.\nThe Isolation I Didn’t See Coming I hate to admit it to myself now, but I became more careful about the clothes I wore, how much make up I put on, what I was posting on social media, and who I hung around with. To no surprise, I basically had no friends my first year and when I wasn’t in classes I was either at my sister’s apartment or alone in my dorm room. I created a dangerous, solitary environment that didn’t allow me to see or admit what was really happening. In the end I just got really good at lying to myself.\nFinding My Own Life Again In my second year I moved off campus into my own apartment, started to make more friends, and became more involved in the community. I started to see glimpses of what the next couple years could look like and I started to allow myself to re-evaluate the life plan I had made in high school. I had always planned to move back home after college, move in together, get engaged at 26, married at 27 and have a child before 30. I had planned my life around this person and I didn’t have a back-up plan, so I couldn’t afford for this one to fail.\nBreaking Up and Moving Forward Ultimately, we both reached our breaking points and ended things after almost a couple years of long distance. We had grown up together and been through a lot, so it was not an easy decision, but it was the right one. Looking back, there are a lot of things I wish I had done differently, but I also know that I wasn’t mature enough at the time to have made the right decisions. You live and you learn, right?\nWas It Worth It? My long distance relationship didn’t end in the fairytale I had originally wanted, but I’m still oddly positive about it. People always wonder if it’s worth it, and if they ask me for advice, I always say it’s worth giving it a shot. It may not have worked out for me in the way I thought it would, but I learned so much about myself, and I know I would have regretted ending things before we even tried.\nWe are no longer on speaking terms so I have no idea what he’d say, but despite the hard times we put each other through, I’d hope he’d also say he didn’t regret trying.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/ldr/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeople always seem to be quite wary about long distance relationships, and for valid reasons.

I thought I had it all figured out, and from the outside it must have looked that way. Sure, my job was not easy and I didn’t like it very much, but I thought eventually I’d find my groove. You know, the way they do in the movies right before everything in their lives comes together and they live happily ever after.\nBut the days and weeks passed and things just weren’t coming together. I was confused and frustrated. I can’t even count the number of times I came home and cried in my husband’s arms. I kept waiting for the day when I’d wake up with a new outlook on life and suddenly things would turn around overnight. Like in The Devil Wears Prada, when Andy gets a makeover, wears couture everyday, and suddenly excels at her job. That\u0026rsquo;s one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but unfortunately it turns out that real life is much more mundane, and the one night of crying they use as a turning point in the story, is actually more like a year.\nI was already in the latter half of my twenties, which meant I should have it all figured out, right? I knew the answer was a big fat NO, but I couldn’t get myself to say it because I was so close to having everything society says I should want. So instead I bought myself some time by practicing morning meditation, going on more frequent vacations and indulging myself in retail therapy. I was doing anything to escape from reality and to no surprise, it came back to bite me in the butt. After half a year of disassociation it caught up to me, all at once, in my first ever panic attack.\nWhen I first started my job I told myself that I would continue until the money no longer became worth it. It was my attempt at keeping my moral compass, and I honestly thought I’d never have to call my own bluff. But after one mental health break and a future that seemed bleak at best, it felt like the time for me to throw in the towel and admit defeat.\nThe first step was admitting to myself that I was lost and struggling. It was scary to admit and in all honesty, I’ve only admitted it to myself in my internal dialogue. But still, it’s a step I wasn’t willing to take before. I haven’t had the courage to really say it out loud, but putting the words onto a page is close enough for now.\nSo here I am, admitting defeat and starting back at square one; sharing my slightly refined, but 100% honest inner dialogue. I am by no means a professional writer so it may not be the easiest read, but putting it onto a page helps me to clear the constant chatter in my head.\nI still don’t know if anyone ever really ‘finds themselves,’ but I hope to at least better understand myself, because right now I can’t really say that I do. I am not brave enough to post on Instagram and share my journey with people I know, nor am I brave enough to show my face on YouTube and try my hand at vlogging. So as of now I will remain faceless as I share bits and pieces of myself and my life, in this very new and confusing chapter.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI got to thinking about what it means to ‘find yourself.’ I naively thought this was something you only had to do once, and once you figured it out, it’d be smooth sailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the typical story arc and I thought I was close to \u0026lsquo;finding myself.\u0026rsquo; It had been almost 10 years since I moved to Japan and I had finally moved to the big city, got my first big girl job, and got married.
