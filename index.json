[{"content":"A Lifelong Dream I’ve always known I wanted kids. I could never quite explain it—it was just something I felt deeply and never questioned. One of my first words was \u0026ldquo;baby,\u0026rdquo; and there are countless childhood photos of me happily holding other people’s babies. It seems I knew what I wanted before I even understood it.\nWaiting for the Right Time Over the years, I babysat whenever I could—mostly for free—simply because I loved it. I spent much of my early twenties waiting for the age when it would finally be “socially acceptable” to have children. And now, in my late twenties it feels like that time has come.I’ve only been married for about six months, but I brought up the topic of kids on our second date. I know that might sound taboo or too forward, but I couldn’t risk not asking early on.\nWhen the Dream Becomes Real Now that the idea is starting to feel more real, I’ve realized how little I actually know—not just about babies, but about pregnancy and raising a child in general. And before I even begin to learn those things, I have to confront something even bigger: I need to reimagine what pregnancy and motherhood would look like—not back home in Hawaiʻi, but here, in Japan.\nWhat I Imagined vs. What\u0026rsquo;s Real Whenever I imagined myself having kids, it was always back home. I saw myself surrounded by family and friends, celebrating a baby shower, setting up a nursery in a house with a yard, and feeling grounded in a place I knew. And even though I’ve now lived in Japan for almost a decade, I never updated that vision.\nFears I Didn\u0026rsquo;t Expect Facing what pregnancy and motherhood might be like in a foreign country is, honestly, terrifying. Maybe that’s why it’s taken me this long to even begin imagining it. There are so many things I never had to think about before that now feel like huge unknowns. I don’t know how to choose a reputable doctor. I don’t know what the cultural expectations are around giving birth here. My family isn’t close by. Even the smaller, more practical things feel daunting—like living in a Tokyo-sized apartment where the nursery I imagined will likely have to share space with the office.\nAnd then there’s my relationship with my body. Like so many women, I’ve struggled with body image for most of my life. I was a gymnast for years and was always very slim. That shaped the way I saw myself, and since then I’ve worked hard not to gain weight, because somewhere along the way I internalized the message that skinny is best. That feeling didn’t ease when I moved to Japan. I quickly realized that my “normal” weight wasn’t considered slim here at all. Ironically, when I go back to Hawaiʻi, my family worries that I look too skinny. It feels vain to admit this, but I’m afraid of how my body will change. I know pregnancy isn’t about aesthetics, and I deeply want this, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried about the physical changes ahead.\nThe Doubts That Follow And then, there’s the most haunting question of all: what if I’m not a good parent? But maybe that’s a topic for another time.\nI’ve waited for this stage of life for as long as I can remember. It should feel like one of the happiest times—but instead, what I feel most is fear. Still, I want to give myself the space to be honest about that. I hope I can use this space as an outlet to share my fears, my learnings, and the journey ahead—wherever it may lead.\nLooking Ahead: A New Kind of Journey In the coming months, I plan to share more about what it’s like navigating pregnancy and motherhood as a foreigner in Japan — from cultural differences and personal experiences to practical tips and step-by-step procedures. I hope this series can be both a resource and a source of comfort for others walking a similar path.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/expecting-abroad/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"a-lifelong-dream\"\u003eA Lifelong Dream\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve always known I wanted kids.

Finding the right place in Tokyo, with its overwhelming options, is a challenge. For those new to the city, it\u0026rsquo;s especially daunting. After learning from my own mistakes, here\u0026rsquo;s what I wish I\u0026rsquo;d known before moving from Kyushu.\nHow to Decide Where to Live Budget This is probably the most important factor, but once you start looking at different options, it’ll be tempting to loosen your budget when you see what’s out there. It’s important to stick to your budget and remember that there are other costs to consider besides the base rent.\nThe 管理費 (maintenance fee), usually around ¥10,000/month, is typically added to the base rent. Also, be prepared for substantial initial fees, often totaling three to four times the monthly rent, including the first one or two months\u0026rsquo; rent paid upfront.\nProximity In a city with seemingly endless choices, proximity is a crucial factor. When I first arrived in Tokyo for graduate school, I prioritized proximity to campus. While this ensured an easy commute to class, it limited my access to other parts of the city.\nWork or school proximity is important, but don’t overlook train station access. In Tokyo, the convenience of the train network can often outweigh the benefits of living right next to your daily destination.\nAlso, while the convenience of major hubs like Shinjuku or Ikebukuro is tempting, consider the sheer volume of daily commuters. If you prefer to avoid large crowds, it may be more practical to live slightly further away from these high-traffic areas.\nHow to Find Places Trains Tokyo’s extensive train network significantly impacts daily life. If you\u0026rsquo;re new to the city, understanding the nuances of each line can be difficult at first.\nI learned that accessibility is key. Popular lines like the Yamanote Line offer exceptional convenience, but come with higher rent. Similarly, properties closer to major stations tend to be more expensive.\nA helpful guideline is to live relatively close to two different stations, ideally one JR line and one Metro line. While one line might seem sufficient, having access to multiple lines significantly improves your flexibility and commute options.## How to Find Places\nSUUMO SUUMO has been my go-to resource for apartment hunting. Its comprehensive listings allow for detailed searches by:\nBudget Station access Layout (1K, 1LDK, 2LDK, etc.) Amenities (e.g., separate toilet and bath, south-facing windows) Other platforms like Open House and Daiwa also exist, but I’ve found SUUMO to be the most thorough—with the added bonus of fewer follow-up sales calls.\nReal Estate Offices After identifying properties on SUUMO, you can request viewings or information, which connects you with a real estate office. Alternatively, you can walk through neighborhoods of interest and view physical listings posted outside local real estate agencies.\nIf you find something promising, inquire directly or schedule an appointment. Viewing multiple properties can feel urgent, but it’s important to remember that this is a big decision. Don’t settle—if something feels off, walk away. There are plenty of other options.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/moving/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"where-to-live-in-tokyo-practical-advice-for-first-time-movers\"\u003eWhere to Live in Tokyo: Practical Advice for First-Time Movers\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article is a bit of a shift from my usual blog entries—rather than personal reflection, I wanted to offer some more \u003cstrong\u003epractical advice\u003c/strong\u003e for those navigating their first move in Tokyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour moves into my Japan experience, and I can confirm: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get less stressful.

After learning from my own mistakes, here\u0026rsquo;s what I wish I\u0026rsquo;d known before moving from Kyushu.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Moving in Japan: Practical Advice for First-Time Movers"},{"content":"Growing Up Without Questioning Identity Growing up in Hawaiʻi as an Asian American, I was part of the ethnic majority. I never had to question my identity—not really—and for that, I know I was incredibly lucky. So when I moved to Japan, I assumed it would be a smooth transition. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but looking back, that assumption was naive.\nExplaining What \u0026ldquo;Asian American\u0026rdquo; Means I never expected that living in Japan would mean repeatedly having to explain what being Asian American actually meant. Yet now, in my ninth year here, I still find myself answering the same questions:\n“So, your parents are from Japan?” “So, you’re half?”\nWhat puzzled me most was that many of the people asking these questions had even been to Hawaiʻi—yet the idea that I, along with my parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and even great-great-grandparents, could all be American was still somehow difficult for them to grasp. I suppose when you\u0026rsquo;re on vacation, concepts like race or ethnicity aren’t things you consciously think about.\nThe Privilege - and Frustration - of Blending In I understand where the assumptions come from. Because of the way I look, people often assume I’m Japanese and that I speak the language fluently. In some ways, that has allowed me to have what people might call an “easier” foreigner experience in Japan. I’ve never been stopped by the police and asked to show my residence card on the street. But even with those privileges, there’s a lingering frustration that comes from having to explain myself over and over again—only to realize that many people still don’t fully understand, or don’t seem interested in learning more.\nPart of that might be on me. I still struggle to articulate my identity clearly, possibly because I’m still in the process of figuring it out myself.\nUniversity and the Search for Belonging During university, I struggled to find my place. I wasn’t sure whether I should try to be more Japanese, or less. At a time of major transition in my life, I just wanted to feel comfortable and accepted. But instead of fitting in, I found myself caught in an identity crisis. For most of my life, I was just “me.” That was enough. But suddenly, I had to explain who I was, and in doing so, I was forced to confront parts of myself in ways I hadn’t before.\nDownplaying One Side, Embracing Another In the beginning, I downplayed the Japanese part of myself. I wanted to prove—almost defensively—that I was American. I did everything but pull out my passport. A lot of that stemmed from the shame I felt at not being able to speak Japanese well, or not knowing much about the culture. I felt like a fraud.\nSo I began to study the language more seriously. I practiced my pronunciation so carefully that people wouldn’t suspect I was a foreigner. I tried to blend in, and for the most part, I succeeded. Japan is a society that often rewards conformity, and at first, I appreciated the ability to move through daily life without being labeled an outsider. But eventually, I realized that blending in too well comes with its own cost—losing sight of who you really are.\nLosing Yourself in the Crowd When I moved to Tokyo, that feeling intensified. In a city of millions, it became even easier to fade into the background. The pressure to conform—to match the norms and expectations around me—never really went away. As a young adult trying to figure out life, it was hard not to fall into that rhythm. I spent my first two years in Tokyo feeling somewhat invisible and even less certain of where I belonged. Entering the workforce brought a whole new set of challenges, but I’ll save that for another time.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve Learned (So Far) Over time, I’ve learned that there’s only so much I can do to explain myself. At the end of the day, it’s up to the other person whether they want to listen or understand. Some people are genuinely curious. Others are just trying to make conversation. And then there are those who simply don’t want to get it—no matter how clearly you explain. In those moments, I’ve learned it’s not always worth the emotional energy to keep trying.\nStill Searching for Balance I still haven’t figured everything out. Ironically, when I visit home in Hawaiʻi now, I feel more like a foreigner than I used to. Living in Japan has changed me, sometimes in ways I didn’t expect. I’m still trying to find balance between all the different parts of myself—American, Asian American, Japanese-passing, English-speaking, outsider, insider.\nIf you’re thinking about moving to Japan, just know that it won’t always be easy. You’ll find that things you thought were stable parts of your identity may get questioned. You’ll be pushed into unfamiliar emotional and cultural terrain. But for me, despite the challenges and frustration, these past nine years have still been worth it.\nThat said, take my story with a grain of salt. Everyone’s experience in Japan is different. I recognize that as someone who passes as Japanese, I’ve been shielded from many of the negative experiences other foreigners face. But if sharing this helps even one person feel a little more seen or understood, then I’m glad I wrote it.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/identity/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"growing-up-without-questioning-identity\"\u003eGrowing Up Without Questioning Identity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up in Hawaiʻi as an Asian American, I was part of the ethnic majority.

I planned to apply to the University of Hawaiʻi as a backup—because that’s what everyone did—but I was mainly interested in schools on the West Coast. I could fully imagine myself in Oregon or Washington. There was already a blueprint available, so it was easy to picture myself setting up my dorm room, performing hula at the annual lūʻau, and widening my circle of (most likely Asian American) friends.\nBut then one day, my mom told me about a Japanese university recruiter who was visiting my high school and holding an information session in one of the Japanese classrooms. Japan hadn’t even been on my radar—I didn’t know it was an option. Still, I was intrigued, so I went. There were only about two other students there. I listened, took a couple of flyers, and looked them over on the way out. I immediately called my mom.\n“I went, but I think there’s a misprint on the flyers. The tuition seems to be missing a couple zeroes,” I told her. Turns out it wasn’t a misprint. And from that point on, my options narrowed down to one.\nI thought maybe I’d go home and become a teacher, but I didn’t have any fixed dreams about my career—which gave me more freedom in choosing a college. All I knew in that moment was that if I attended college in Japan, I would graduate debt-free and wouldn’t be putting too much economic stress on my parents.\nA Quick Decision That Changed Everything Luckily, I was accepted with a generous scholarship, so the decision was easy. I’m known to make decisions pretty quickly, no matter how serious they may be. Strangely enough, smaller things—like what heels I’d wear for my wedding—took me months. But I decided on college in about five minutes. Then I got started on my visa application and packed my life into a few boxes and suitcases. Not many students from my high school studied abroad, so there was no blueprint for this, but I just kept charging ahead.\nWhat Studying Abroad Actually Felt Like The next four years are a bit of a blur now that I look back, but I know that if I had the chance to do it all over again, I would. I struggled deeply with feelings of loneliness and homesickness, on top of adjusting to the language and cultural barriers. But it was also the first time in my life that I had so much time to myself—and I learned how to be alone. It was uncomfortable and terrifying, but it taught me how to be independent. Living abroad forces you to confront yourself in ways you never imagined.\nOnce I got used to the loneliness and the discomfort of it all, I realized how sheltered I’d been—how dependent I was on my parents. I’d also been at the same school for thirteen years, surrounded by basically the same group of people. I grew up in a bubble. Going to college abroad gave me the chance to meet new people, see new perspectives, and be exposed to completely different ways of living and thinking.\nIt Wasn\u0026rsquo;t Really About the Classes I know college is supposed to be about the classes you take, the research you do, and the degree that sets you up for your future—but that wasn’t really the case for me. When people—often high schoolers thinking about studying in Japan—ask me what college here is like, they usually want to know about the course load and how it prepares you for your future.\nBut in my experience, studying abroad wasn’t really about the studying. I can only remember a handful of classes and professors. To sum it up in one word, it was fine. Most of the student body spoke English as a second language, so the curriculum wasn’t as rigorous as it probably would’ve been in the U.S. If anything, studying abroad felt more like a necessary step in my personal growth and overall life experience, as opposed to the academic experience others might seek out.\nWhy the Friendships Meant So Much More Abroad For an ambitious high schooler, that may seem like an insufficient answer. But for me, the things I remember most are the moments outside the classroom. And what remains are the friendships I made. I know making friends in college is the norm, but making friends while you’re abroad leads to a different kind of connection. In an environment far from home, family, and everything familiar, you cling to each other—and the bonds you form go much deeper than the surface.\nI’ve never experienced college back home, so I can’t say whether one is better than the other—but I know I don’t regret my decision. It was a profound experience that changed the trajectory of my life in more ways than one, and while I may not have thought that while I was in the thick of it, time and a little bit of distance will do that.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/college-in-japan/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-unexpected-path-that-led-me-to-japan\"\u003eThe Unexpected Path That Led Me to Japan\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I approached my senior year of high school, I debated which colleges to apply to.

It usually comes down to a cost-benefit analysis; wondering whether the short amount of time you do have together is worth the time spent apart and loneliness and challenges that come with distance. And there is no right answer; there’s just too many unknown variables.\nThe Start of Our Long Distance Relationship But as a stupid 18 year old I didn’t even think twice and I had just accepted it as a chapter of our relationship that we’d just have to get through. I knew that choosing to live abroad in Japan meant that a long distance relationship would be inevitable, but like any naive high schooler I thought that love conquered all. Even though my mom nudged me to break things off before I moved to Japan, I was as stubborn as ever, and even slightly insulted that she would even bring it up. In retrospect I know she was just trying to protect me from the inevitable heartbreak, but I couldn’t see it at the time.\nNaive Expectations and Real-Life Struggles We went into it pretty blindly with the end goal being four long years away. We made up our own rules as we went along, each more unrealistic and stupid than the last. We were just kids who didn’t know what it meant to be in a healthy relationship, let alone a long distance one. We already had problems before I left for Japan and the ocean between us only made things worse. My entire existence began to revolve around him and it was starting to become unhealthy. But this was the only relationship I knew, so it was easy to dismiss the signs.\nThe Isolation I Didn’t See Coming I hate to admit it to myself now, but I became more careful about the clothes I wore, how much make up I put on, what I was posting on social media, and who I hung around with. To no surprise, I basically had no friends my first year and when I wasn’t in classes I was either at my sister’s apartment or alone in my dorm room. I created a dangerous, solitary environment that didn’t allow me to see or admit what was really happening. In the end I just got really good at lying to myself.\nFinding My Own Life Again In my second year I moved off campus into my own apartment, started to make more friends, and became more involved in the community. I started to see glimpses of what the next couple years could look like and I started to allow myself to re-evaluate the life plan I had made in high school. I had always planned to move back home after college, move in together, get engaged at 26, married at 27 and have a child before 30. I had planned my life around this person and I didn’t have a back-up plan, so I couldn’t afford for this one to fail.\nBreaking Up and Moving Forward Ultimately, we both reached our breaking points and ended things after almost a couple years of long distance. We had grown up together and been through a lot, so it was not an easy decision, but it was the right one. Looking back, there are a lot of things I wish I had done differently, but I also know that I wasn’t mature enough at the time to have made the right decisions. You live and you learn, right?\nWas It Worth It? My long distance relationship didn’t end in the fairytale I had originally wanted, but I’m still oddly positive about it. People always wonder if it’s worth it, and if they ask me for advice, I always say it’s worth giving it a shot. It may not have worked out for me in the way I thought it would, but I learned so much about myself, and I know I would have regretted ending things before we even tried.\nWe are no longer on speaking terms so I have no idea what he’d say, but despite the hard times we put each other through, I’d hope he’d also say he didn’t regret trying.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/ldr/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePeople always seem to be quite wary about long distance relationships, and for valid reasons.

You know, the way they do in the movies right before everything in their lives comes together and they live happily ever after.\nWhen the Dream Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Feel Like it Should But the days and weeks passed and things just weren’t coming together. I was confused and frustrated. I can’t even count the number of times I came home and cried in my husband’s arms. I kept waiting for the day when I’d wake up with a new outlook on life and suddenly things would turn around overnight. Like in The Devil Wears Prada, when Andy gets a makeover, wears couture everyday, and suddenly excels at her job. That\u0026rsquo;s one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but unfortunately it turns out that real life is much more mundane, and the one night of crying they use as a turning point in the story, is actually more like a year.\nThe Breaking Point I was already in the latter half of my twenties, which meant I should have it all figured out, right? I knew the answer was a big fat NO, but I couldn’t get myself to say it because I was so close to having everything society says I should want. So instead I bought myself some time by practicing morning meditation, going on more frequent vacations and indulging myself in retail therapy. I was doing anything to escape from reality and to no surprise, it came back to bite me in the butt. After half a year of disassociation it caught up to me, all at once, in my first ever panic attack.\nWhen I first started my job I told myself that I would continue until the money no longer became worth it. It was my attempt at keeping my moral compass, and I honestly thought I’d never have to call my own bluff. But after one mental health break and a future that seemed bleak at best, it felt like the time for me to throw in the towel and admit defeat.\nAdmitting Defeat The first step was admitting to myself that I was lost and struggling. It was scary to admit and in all honesty, I’ve only admitted it to myself in my internal dialogue. But still, it’s a step I wasn’t willing to take before. I haven’t had the courage to really say it out loud, but putting the words onto a page is close enough for now.\nStarting From Scratch - One Page at a Time So here I am, admitting defeat and starting back at square one; sharing my slightly refined, but 100% honest inner dialogue. I am by no means a professional writer so it may not be the easiest read, but putting it onto a page helps me to clear the constant chatter in my head.\nI still don’t know if anyone ever really ‘finds themselves,’ but I hope to at least better understand myself, because right now I can’t really say that I do. I am not brave enough to post on Instagram and share my journey with people I know, nor am I brave enough to show my face on YouTube and try my hand at vlogging. So as of now I will remain faceless as I share bits and pieces of myself and my life, in this very new and confusing chapter.\n","permalink":"https://tokyodiaries.com/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"the-myth-of-finding-yourself\"\u003eThe Myth of \u0026lsquo;Finding Yourself\u0026rsquo;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to thinking about what it means to ‘find yourself.’ I naively thought this was something you only had to do once, and once you figured it out, it’d be smooth sailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the typical story arc and I thought I was close to \u0026lsquo;finding myself.\u0026rsquo; It had been almost 10 years since I moved to Japan and I had finally moved to the big city, got my first big girl job, and got married.
